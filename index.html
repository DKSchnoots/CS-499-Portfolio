            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I’ve been within the computer science program for nearly two years, before attending SNHU for my bachelor’s in CS with a concentration in Software Engineering, I attended a community college in Charlotte, NC for Video Game Development and Simulation. I gained quite a few credits and different types of experience in the computer world from the college that I brought over when I transferred. While in the Computer Science program, I learned important ideas in Software engineering, such as the Software Development Life Cycle, and gained project management skills. I have also acquired the important fundamentals of Computer Architecture, referring to my understanding of how computers manage information. Another concept I have become familiar with is Databases and data structures. I have learned much about database design and how data travels within applications and with the systems involved.</p>

            <h2>Artifact One</h2>
            <p>For Category One, I have chosen to use a project from CS-340. This project is called the “Grazioso Salvare Project” which was designed as a Web Application Dashboard that utilized CRUD operations to access and store information from a database dictionary storing the data. This artifact was written in Python and utilized Mongo from the data. This project allows an authorized user to access a database with existing data about animals at a shelter. It allows authorized users to initiate CRUD functions (create, read, update, delete) within the correct database. The data is then displayed in a terminal dashboard.<br>
                <br>

                <br>
                I chose to incorporate this artifact because it was something that was created on Linux and I wanted to see how well it would work on Windows/Android. I selected this artifact to  enhance it by moving the original Python web-based interface to a mobile app using Java and XML. Instead of using Mongo as the web-based interface. Unlike the interface, I added a graphical UI that incorporates buttons using the XML formats. Each XML file has a correlating Java file that controls the actions of the objects within the interface. <br>
                With the enhancements, I am demonstrating my skills in developing software, project management, system analysis, and professional communication. I show my ability by design user-friendly interfaces that has been enhanced for mobile devices. I have also shown my ability to generate cross-platform designs that embraces the original idea and tasks of the web application interface. I demonstrate my skill to manage a project by including my plan and dividing the tasks based on the requirements of the application such as the CRUD operations.

            <h2>Artifact Two</h2>
            <p>For Artifact Two, I intend to use an artifact from CS320 that created a way to store contacts. The contact service uses in-memory data structures to support storing contacts (no database required). In addition, there is no user interface for this milestone project. The current version of this assignment used a Hashmap to store data for the contacts</p>

            <h2>Artifact Three</h2>
            <p>For Category Three, I will use a project from CS-340 once again. This project is the “Grazioso Salvare Project” which is a Web Application Dashboard/Interface that utilizes CRUD operations to access and store information from a database dictionary storing the data. This artifact allows authorized users to access the database with existing data about animals at a shelter. It also allows authorized users to begin CRUD operations (create, read, update, delete) within the database. The data is then reflected in a dashboard/interface.</p>
