            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I’ve been within the computer science program for nearly two years, before attending SNHU for my bachelor’s in CS with a concentration in Software Engineering, I attended a community college in Charlotte, NC for Video Game Development and Simulation. I gained quite a few credits and different types of experience in the computer world from the college that I brought over when I transferred. While in the Computer Science program, I learned important ideas in Software engineering, such as the Software Development Life Cycle, and gained project management skills. I have also acquired the important fundamentals of Computer Architecture, referring to my understanding of how computers manage information. Another concept I have become familiar with is Databases and data structures. I have learned much about database design and how data travels within applications and with the systems involved.</p>

            <h2>Artifact One: Software Design and Engineering</h2>
            <p>
            For Category One, I have chosen to use a project from CS-340. This project is called the “Grazioso Salvare Project” which was designed as a Web Application Dashboard that utilized CRUD operations to access and store information from a database dictionary storing the data. This artifact was written in Python and utilized Mongo from the data. This project allows an authorized user to access a database with existing data about animals at a shelter. It allows authorized users to initiate CRUD functions (create, read, update, delete) within the correct database. The data is then displayed in a terminal dashboard.<br><br>
            You can view the project repository on GitHub <a href="https://github.com/DKSchnoots/CS-499-Portfolio/tree/c117d76962d13c39c40e53f293ea286bbbc2f5d0/CS499_ArtifactOneEnhancements" target="_blank">here</a>.<br><br>
            I chose to incorporate this artifact because it was something that was created on Linux and I wanted to see how well it would work on Windows/Android. I selected this artifact to enhance it by moving the original Python web-based interface to a mobile app using Java and XML. Instead of using Mongo as the web-based interface, I added a graphical UI that incorporates buttons using the XML formats. Each XML file has a correlating Java file that controls the actions of the objects within the interface.<br><br>
            With the enhancements, I am demonstrating my skills in developing software, project management, system analysis, and professional communication. I show my ability by designing user-friendly interfaces that have been enhanced for mobile devices. I have also shown my ability to generate cross-platform designs that embrace the original idea and tasks of the web application interface. I demonstrate my skill to manage a project by including my plan and dividing the tasks based on the requirements of the application such as the CRUD operations.

            <h2>Artifact Two: Algorithms and Data Structures</h2>
            <p>
            For Artifact Two, I intend to use an artifact from CS320 that created a way to store contacts. The contact service uses in-memory data structures to support storing contacts (no database required). In addition, there is no user interface for this milestone project. The current version of this assignment used a Hashmap to store data for the contacts. <br><br>
            You can view the project repository on GitHub <a href="https://github.com/DKSchnoots/CS-499-Portfolio/tree/9aa7a0e258cc4caef2a9a7fb66adca48e7fbb131/CS499ContactServices" target="_blank">here</a>.<br><br>
            I converted the current data structure (hash map) into an AVL Tree in Java. The tree is more compact and has a more valuable way of ordering data. maintaining a sorted order for the elements in an entry, performing ordered operations, and still requiring relatively efficient access, insertion, and deletion. By also updating this artifact, a UI element was added to help interact with the application. I was able to show my skills in problem-solving, analytical skills, design skills, and optimization skills. I was able to create a tree to optimize the space usage as well as a more secure way to organize the data input using an array and CLI. I was able to save on overhead memory while also making the implementation more complex for myself due to the tree setup.<br><br>
            By designing this tree successfully, I showed my ability to utilize a more complex yet helpful way to store the data that could then be used in the future for larger projects. I was able to show my skills in optimization by converting the HashMap to a tree to optimize the allocated memory for the device used.

            <h2>Artifact Three: Databases</h2>
            <p>
            For Category Three, I will use a project from CS-340 once again. This project is the “Grazioso Salvare Project” which is a Web Application Dashboard/Interface that utilizes CRUD operations to access and store information from a database dictionary storing the data. This artifact allows authorized users to access the database with existing data about animals at a shelter. It also allows authorized users to begin CRUD operations (create, read, update, delete) within the database. The data is then reflected in a dashboard/interface. <br><br>
            You can view the project repository on GitHub <a href="https://github.com/DKSchnoots/CS-499-Portfolio/tree/c117d76962d13c39c40e53f293ea286bbbc2f5d0/CS499_ArtifactThreeEnhancements" target="_blank">here</a>.<br><br>
            The original version of this artifact used MongoDB for its database needs. In this enhancement, I utilized a client plug-in for SQLite to store information locally, allowing the app to access data seamlessly from the backend to the front end. Unlike the original version, where user login information was stored locally and insecurely due to the way the project was originally set up, I implemented an additional database to securely house this information. This enhancement not only improves data security but also demonstrates my ability to integrate different database technologies and enhance application security.<br><br>
            The enhancements for category three demonstrated my ability to use well-founded and innovative techniques, skills, and tools in computing practices to implement computer solutions that deliver value and accomplish industry-specific goals. By using the CRUD functions, I was able to show how the data is stored, how it is used and the data flows between the frontend and the backend.
