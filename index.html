            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I’ve been within the computer science program for nearly two years, before attending SNHU for my bachelor’s in CS with a concentration in Software Engineering, I attended a community college in Charlotte, NC for Video Game Development and Simulation. I gained quite a few credits and different types of experience in the computer world from the college that I brought over when I transferred. While in the Computer Science program, I learned important ideas in Software engineering, such as the Software Development Life Cycle, and gained project management skills. I have also acquired the important fundamentals of Computer Architecture, referring to my understanding of how computers manage information. Another concept I have become familiar with is Databases and data structures. I have learned much about database design and how data travels within applications and with the systems involved.</p>
